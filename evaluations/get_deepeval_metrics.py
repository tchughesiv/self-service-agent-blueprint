    Create comprehensive evaluation metrics for laptop refresh conversation assessment.

    This function defines a suite of conversational metrics specifically designed
    to evaluate IT support conversations related to laptop refresh requests.
    Includes both standard conversation metrics and custom laptop-specific criteria.

    Args:
        custom_model: Optional custom LLM model instance to use for evaluations.
                     If None, uses the default DeepEval model.

    Returns:
        List[ConversationalGEval]: List of evaluation metrics including:
            - Turn Relevancy: Measures relevance of assistant responses
            - Role Adherence: Evaluates adherence to IT support agent role
            - Conversation Completeness: Assesses conversation flow completeness
            - Information Gathering: Evaluates laptop info collection
            - Policy Compliance: Checks laptop refresh policy application
            - Option Presentation: Assesses laptop option presentation quality
            - Process Completion: Evaluates complete laptop refresh process
            - User Experience: Measures helpfulness and professionalism
