      The user said: "{last_user_message}"

      Analyze their request and determine what they need help with:

      1. LAPTOP_REFRESH - User wants help with laptop refresh, replacement, new laptop, laptop upgrade, hardware refresh. Also includes requests that just say "refresh" or similar terms.
      2. EMAIL_CHANGE - User wants to update, change, or modify their email address
      3. OTHER - User needs help with something else or request is unclear

      Examples of LAPTOP_REFRESH requests:
      - "I need a new laptop"
      - "laptop refresh"
      - "refresh"
      - "I want to refresh my laptop"
      - "hardware refresh"

      Respond with exactly one of: LAPTOP_REFRESH, EMAIL_CHANGE, or OTHER
