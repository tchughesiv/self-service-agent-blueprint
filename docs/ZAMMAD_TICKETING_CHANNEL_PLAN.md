# Zammad Ticketing Channel Integration Plan

**Status**: In progress — webhook + RM path landed; optional **Webhook/Trigger bootstrap** (`zammad-bootstrap`, see game plan §5.2.1). Gaps: [Ticketing Channel Game Plan](TICKETING_CHANNEL_GAMEPLAN.md) §2.3 (ticket-type gating, owner/author `user_id`, MCP reply rules).  
**Related**: [APPENG-4759](../APPENG-4759); [ai-quickstart-contrib #18](https://github.com/rh-ai-quickstart/ai-quickstart-contrib/issues/18) — speeding up ticket resolution time  
**Last updated**: 2026-04-27

**Implementation touchpoints:** See [Ticketing Channel Game Plan](TICKETING_CHANNEL_GAMEPLAN.md) for codebase locations and required changes.

## Executive Summary

Add **Zammad** as the primary ticketing-native channel to the self-service agent blueprint. Zammad is **free and open source** (AGPL v3, no license fee). Tickets and articles = support cases; the agent uses the community [Zammad-MCP](https://github.com/basher83/Zammad-MCP) for ticket actions. **Leverage the built-in chat widget**: when a user sends a message via the chat, Zammad creates a ticket with articles; our agent replies via MCP (add article); the reply appears in the chat UI in real time — no standalone chat UI needed.

User posts via chat, email, or web form → webhook triggers agent → agent replies via MCP → user sees response in chat or ticket view. Multi-turn conversation lives in the ticket article thread.

---

## Why Zammad as Primary Ticketing-Native Option?

| Criterion | Zammad | Znuny | Gitea |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------|
| **Purpose-built ticketing** | Yes (helpdesk) | Yes (OTRS fork) | No (git issues) |
| **Free / open source** | Yes (AGPL) | Yes (GPL) | Yes |
| **Self-hosted** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Built-in chat widget** | **Yes** — real-time UI | No | No |
| **Webhooks** | Triggers, X-Hub-Signature, retries | Web Service Notification | Gitea webhooks |
| **Helm chart** | Official (zammad-helm) | Community | Official |
| **MCP server** | Community ([Zammad-MCP](https://github.com/basher83/Zammad-MCP)) | Community (znuny_mcp) | Official (gitea-mcp) |
| **Stack complexity** | Elasticsearch (optional) | Lighter | Lightest |

Zammad’s built-in chat widget suits our needs: chat messages become ticket articles; our agent’s replies (added via MCP/REST API) appear in the chat in real time. No need to build a custom chat UI.

---

## Incoming vs Outgoing

| Direction | Mechanism | Who initiates | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| **Incoming** (Zammad → blueprint) | Zammad triggers (webhooks) | Zammad POSTs to our endpoint on ticket/article create | New `POST /zammad/webhook` route. Configure trigger in Zammad Admin. |
| **Outgoing** (blueprint → Zammad) | Agent uses Zammad MCP | Agent calls `zammad_add_article`, `zammad_get_ticket`, etc. | MCP → Zammad REST API; dispatcher uses **no-op** `ZammadIntegrationHandler` for pipeline compatibility |

**Why MCP for outgoing:** Agent can add articles, update status, assign, search tickets — not just post a single reply. Single integration surface (MCP) for read + write. The integration-dispatcher still registers a **no-op** Zammad delivery handler so the unified delivery pipeline does not error when `IntegrationType.ZAMMAD` appears.

---

## Interaction Model: Ticket Articles + Chat Widget

- **Chat flow**: User opens chat widget (embedded on site) → sends message → Zammad creates ticket with article → webhook fires → agent processes → agent adds article via MCP → **reply appears in chat UI** (chat is backed by ticket articles)
- **Email / web form flow**: Same pattern — ticket created → webhook → agent replies via MCP → user sees reply in ticket view or via email notification
- Full conversation in ticket article thread; session continuity via `ticket_id`

### Delivery Path: Chat Widget Responses via MCP

**Agent responses to the Zammad chat widget are delivered exclusively via MCP.** There is no Integration Dispatcher delivery handler for Zammad. The flow:

1. User sends message in chat widget → Zammad creates ticket article → webhook → agent processes
2. Agent calls `zammad_add_article` via Zammad MCP
3. MCP server posts to Zammad REST API → ticket article created
4. Chat widget displays the new article (chat is a view of ticket articles)

This differs from Slack/Email, where responses go through the Integration Dispatcher delivery pipeline and handlers post to each configured channel. For Zammad, the agent performs delivery directly via MCP; the dispatcher’s `ZammadIntegrationHandler` is a **no-op** (success without posting).

**Chat widget behavior:** Zammad shows the chat only when at least one agent is available. To support an AI-first flow, create a dedicated Zammad agent user for the AI and keep it “available” (or use triggers to auto-assign chat sessions). The AI agent responds via MCP; its articles appear in the chat. Alternatively, configure “Leave a message” mode if chat should work when no human is online — messages become tickets; our agent processes asynchronously.

---

## Knowledge Base & RAG

**No built-in wiki in Zammad.** For **APPENG-4759** (laptop refresh ticket channel), KB is the existing **laptop-refresh** corpus:

- `config/knowledge_bases/laptop-refresh/` — .txt files
- LlamaStack vector store → RAG
- Ticketing agent: `ticket-laptop-refresh` with `knowledge_bases: ["laptop-refresh"]`

No sync from Zammad; KB is managed as static files or via ingestion pipeline.

---

## Agent behavior (APPENG-4759 / laptop refresh)

The **Zammad ticket channel** uses the same **`ticket-laptop-refresh`** agent as the phase-1 ticket flow, with **snow** + **zammad** MCP servers. In scope for 4759:

1. **Laptop refresh policy and catalog** — RAG over `knowledge_bases: ["laptop-refresh"]`; ServiceNow flows via snow MCP as today.
2. **Ticket thread** — Ingest customer articles via webhook → request manager; reply with **`zammad_add_article`** (and related Zammad MCP tools), not dispatcher delivery.
3. **State gating** — Only automate replies when the ticket is **agent-managed laptop refresh**; respect **waiting for human review** (exact Zammad mapping TBD).

Broader “generic IT triage” (printers, password SOPs, etc.) is **out of scope** for this ticket; see [issue #18](https://github.com/rh-ai-quickstart/ai-quickstart-contrib/issues/18) for longer-term ideas.

---

## Escalation Flow

**MCP actions (Zammad-MCP):**

| Action | MCP tool | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Add escalation article | `zammad_add_article` | "Escalating — [summary]. Recommended fix: [X]." |
| Update ticket | `zammad_update_ticket` | Assign, change state, priority |
| Assign to human | `zammad_update_ticket` (owner) | Assign to support agent |

**Flow TBD:** Trigger logic (when to escalate), state names, owner resolution.

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Zammad MCP + Agent Config (Foundation)

**Goal**: Agent can read/update Zammad tickets via MCP.

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| Deploy Zammad MCP | Use [Zammad-MCP](https://github.com/basher83/Zammad-MCP) (AGPL-3.0). Deploy via Docker (`ghcr.io/basher83/zammad-mcp`) or uvx. Requires `ZAMMAD_URL` (include `/api/v1`), `ZAMMAD_HTTP_TOKEN`. Supports stdio and HTTP transports. |
| Helm integration | Add Zammad MCP deployment; config similar to Snow MCP (`mcp_servers` in agent YAML). |
| Agent config | Add Zammad MCP to ticketing/resolution agent; expose `zammad_get_ticket`, `zammad_add_article`, `zammad_search_tickets`, `zammad_update_ticket`, etc. |
| Ticketing agent | `ticket-laptop-refresh` with **snow + zammad** MCP + `knowledge_bases: ["laptop-refresh"]`. Input/output shields (Llama Guard). |

**Deliverables**: Agent can create tickets, add articles, search tickets via MCP.

---

### Phase 2: Zammad Webhook → Request Manager (Incoming Channel)

**Goal**: Ticket/article events trigger agent processing.

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| IntegrationType | Add `ZAMMAD` to `IntegrationType` enum in shared-models. |
| Zammad webhook handler | **New** route `POST /zammad/webhook`. Zammad triggers POST to our endpoint. Verify `X-Hub-Signature` (HMAC-SHA1) with trigger secret. **Filter:** ignore events where article creator is the agent’s Zammad user (prevent feedback loop). Group allowlist: only process configured groups. |
| Event mapping | Map ticket create / article create (customer/external) → CloudEvent `request.created`. Skip internal notes, agent articles. Use `X-Zammad-Delivery` for deduplication. |
| Request schema | `ZammadRequest` in `request-manager/.../schemas.py` with `ticket_id`, `article_id`, `group_id`, `group_name`, `owner_id`, `created_by_id`, `zammad_delivery_id`. |
| Normalizer | `_normalize_zammad_request`: `target_agent_id="ticket-laptop-refresh"`, `requires_routing=False`; `integration_context` carries ticket metadata; `session_id`: `zammad-{ticket_id}`. **4759 follow-up:** branch on ticket state / new vs follow-up. |
| Request Manager | Add `elif integration_type == IntegrationType.ZAMMAD:` branch; create `ZammadRequest`. |
| Response delivery | **No-op handler.** Agent delivers via MCP; dispatcher registers `ZammadIntegrationHandler` that returns success without posting (avoids pipeline errors). |

**Deliverables**: New ticket or customer article triggers agent; agent replies via MCP; reply appears in chat or ticket view.

---

### Phase 3: Chat Widget Integration (Leverage Built-in UI)

**Goal**: Ensure chat widget is usable for AI-assisted support.

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| AI agent user | Create Zammad user for AI agent; assign Agent role. |
| Agent availability | Keep AI agent “available” (or use triggers to auto-assign) so chat widget is visible. Alternatively, use “Leave a message” mode. |
| Chat widget config | Configure chat in Zammad Admin (Channels → Chat). Embed widget script on target site. |
| Validation | User sends chat message → webhook → agent replies via MCP → reply appears in chat. |

**Deliverables**: Chat widget provides real-time UI; AI replies visible in chat. No custom chat UI needed.

---

### Phase 4: Demo Pre-population (Deployment / Demo)

**Goal**: Seed Zammad with sample data at quickstart boot.

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| Zammad deployment | Add Zammad as optional component via **`ticketingZammad`** subchart; **`make helm-install-ticketing`**. |
| Init / seed | Create sample groups, sample tickets. No GH sync (Zammad is not git-based). |
| Webhook + Trigger | **`zammad-bootstrap`** can register Zammad **Webhook** + **Trigger** (REST) when `ZAMMAD_INTEGRATION_WEBHOOK_URL` is set — see [Ticketing Channel Game Plan](TICKETING_CHANNEL_GAMEPLAN.md) §5.2.1 and `helm/zammad` `bootstrap.integrationWebhook`. |
| Helm integration | Zammad ticketing ties into `make helm-install-test`, `helm/values.yaml`. Zammad, Zammad MCP as conditional blocks (`zammad.enabled`). |

---

## Future / v2

Per [issue #18](https://github.com/rh-ai-quickstart/ai-quickstart-contrib/issues/18):

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Docling for PDFs** | Extract information from PDFs (attachments, KB docs) into the knowledge base. |
| **Multi-model for images** | Analyze screenshots attached to tickets (e.g. error dialogs, UI issues) with vision-capable models. |
| **Optional resolved-ticket creation** | When the agent resolves via chat, create a summarized "resolved" ticket for audit (per Pete Davis comment in issue #18). |
| **Zammad AI Provider integration** | Optional: Point Zammad's built-in AI (Ticket Summary, Writing Assistant, AI Agents) at LlamaStack via Custom/OpenAI-compatible provider. For human agents using Zammad UI; separate from our webhook+MCP agent. See [Zammad AI Provider docs](https://admin-docs.zammad.org/en/pre-release/ai/provider.html). |
| **Proactive work on idle tickets** | Zammad Time Event trigger (e.g., "Ticket Pending Time Reached") fires webhook when ticket idle; agent adds suggested resolution via MCP. Preferred over CronJob — reuses webhook, no extra infra. |

Out of scope for v1.

---

## Deployment & Helm Integration

**Assumption:** Zammad ticketing integrates with the existing Helm install mechanism.

| Existing mechanism | Zammad ticketing fit |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| `make helm-install-test` / `helm-install-prod` | Add `zammad.enabled`, `zammad.mcp.enabled` flags |
| `helm/values.yaml` | Add `zammad` block (url, webhookSecret, defaultGroup, mcp.uri) |
| `make deploy-email-server` | Analogous optional add-on pattern to **`make helm-install-ticketing`** (ticketing + Zammad stack). |
| Init job | Optional: create AI agent user, sample groups |

**Zammad official Helm chart:** [zammad/zammad-helm](https://github.com/zammad/zammad-helm) — use as subchart or dependency.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Zammad instance | Self-hosted; Docker or Helm |
| Zammad MCP server | [Zammad-MCP](https://github.com/basher83/Zammad-MCP) — community; holds Zammad API token |
| Zammad trigger | Configured in Zammad Admin for webhook POST |
| Request Manager | Add `ZammadRequest` handling |
| Integration Dispatcher | Add `POST /zammad/webhook` route |
| Agent Service | Add Zammad MCP config |

---

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Zammad MCP community-maintained | Review codebase; consider contributing. Fallback: minimal MCP wrapper around Zammad REST API. |
| Feedback loop | Filter webhooks where article creator is AI agent’s Zammad user. |
| Chat requires agent available | Create AI agent user; keep available or use “Leave a message” mode. |
| Elasticsearch (optional) | Zammad can run without ES for smaller deployments. |

---

## Audit: Gaps, Security, Performance

### Critical Gaps

| Gap | Mitigation |
|-----|------------|
| **Feedback loop** | Ignore webhooks where `article.created_by_id` matches AI agent’s Zammad user. |
| **Request Manager** | Add ZAMMAD branch. |
| **Session ID** | `zammad-{ticket_id}`. |
| **Event filtering** | Only process ticket create + article create (customer/external). Skip internal notes, agent articles. |

### Security

| Item | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| **Webhook signature** | Verify `X-Hub-Signature` (HMAC-SHA1) with trigger secret. |
| **Group allowlist** | Only process configured groups. |
| **MCP token** | Store in K8s Secret; never log. |
| **Rate limiting** | Rate-limit webhook endpoint. |
| **Safety shields** | Input/output shields on `ticket-laptop-refresh` agent. |

### Performance

| Item | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| **MCP call volume** | Agent may make multiple ticket/article calls. Monitor; back off on errors. |
| **Webhook retries** | Zammad retries up to 4 times on failure. Handle idempotently via `X-Zammad-Delivery`. |
| **Deduplication** | Use `X-Zammad-Delivery` for idempotency. |
